# AMI - Amazon Machine Image

**An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an image that provides the software that is required to set up and boot an Amazon EC2 instance. 
Each AMI also contains a block device mapping that specifies the block devices to attach to the instances that you launch. 
You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance.
The AMI must be compatible with the instance type that you chose for your instance. 
You can use an AMI provided by AWS, a public AMI, an AMI that someone else shared with you, or an AMI that you purchased from the AWS Marketplace.**
